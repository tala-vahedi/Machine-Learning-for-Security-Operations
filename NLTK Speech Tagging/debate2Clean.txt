Joe Biden,First of all my heart goes out to those who have already lost someone or those who are suffering from the virus and this is bigger than any one of us This calls for a national rallying to everybody move together and I laid out in detail what I would do were I president today You can go to joebidencom I laid it out in significant detail but there are three pieces of this First of all have to take care of those who in fact are exposed or are likely to be exposed to the virus and that means we have to do testing We have to get the testing kits up and ready
Joe Biden,I would have the World Health Organization Id take advantage of the test kits they have available to us even though the president says a million or more are coming lets just get all the tests we can done as quickly as we can Secondly I would make sure that every state in the union had at least  places where they had drivethrough testing arrangements I would also at this point deal with the need to begin to plan for the need for additional hospital beds We have that capacity in the Department of Defense as well as with the FEMA and they can set up hundredbed bed hospitals and tents quickly
Joe Biden,We have to lay all that out but we have to deal with the economic fallout quickly and that means making sure that people who in fact lose their job dont get a paycheck cant pay their mortgage are able to pay it and pay them now and do it now Small businesses be able to borrow interestfree loans I see my time is up here Youre going to hold us tightly I assume but thats what I would do Go to joebidencom It lays out precisely what I would do were I president today
Bernie Sanders,Well first thing we have got to do whether or not Im president is to shut this president up right now because he is undermining the doctors and the scientists who are trying to help the American people It is unacceptable for him to be blabbering with unfactual information which is confusing the general public Second of all what we need to do and Im glad that he has called a state of national emergency What we have got to do is move aggressively to make sure that every person in this country finally understands that when they get sick with the coronavirus that all payments will be made that they dont have to worry about coming up with money for testing They dont have to worry about coming up with money for treatment
Bernie Sanders,This is an unprecedented moment in American history Now I obviously believe in Medicare for all I will fight for that as president but right now in this emergency I want every person in this country to understand that when you get sick you go to the doctor When you get sick if you have the virus that will be paid for Do not worry about the cost right now because were in the middle of a national emergency
Bernie Sanders,Second of all we have to make sure that our hospitals have the ventilators that they need have the IC units that they need Right now we have a lack of medical personnel and I worry very much that if there is a peak whether we have the capability of dealing with the hundreds of thousands of people who may be in hospitals so we need unprecedented action right now to deal with the unprecedented crisis Bottom line from an economic point of view what we have got to say to the American people if you lose your job you will be made whole Youre not going to lose income If Trump can put or the fed can put a trillion and a half into the banking system
Bernie Sanders,we can protect the wages of every worker in America
Joe Biden,No Look the World Health Organization offered offered the testing kits that they have available and to give it to us now We refused them We did not want to buy them We did not want to get them from them We wanted to make sure we had our own I think he said something like We have the best scientists in America or something to that effect The idea that we are not prepared for this and not  The other thing I want to point out and I agree with Bernie were in a situation where we have to now be providing for the hospitals that are going to be needed needed now
Joe Biden,The present system cannot handle the surge that is likely to come so we should already be sitting down and planning where were going to put these temporary hospitals and we can do that We did that  Weve been through this before with the coronavirus Weve been through this  I mean excuse me weve been through this before with dealing with the viruses that the NH as well as what happened in Africa We provided these hospitals dealing with these great pandemics and were able to do it quickly and people would have a place to go but we also have to provide the equipment to protect the first responders and thats not being done either
Bernie Sanders,Jake lets be honest and understand that this coronavirus pandemic exposes the incredible weakness and dysfunctionality of our current healthcare system Now were spending twice as much per person on healthcare as the people of any other country How in Gods name does it happen that we end up with  million people who are uninsured or underinsured and there are people who are watching this program tonight and say Im not feeling well Should I go to the doctor But I cant afford to go to the doctor What happens if I am sick Its going to cost thousands of dollars for treatment Whos going to feed my kids We are the only major country on earth not to guarantee healthcare to all people
Bernie Sanders,Were spending so much money and yet we are not even prepared for this pandemic How come we dont have enough doctors How come hospitals in rural areas are shutting down How come people cant afford to get the prescription drugs they need because we have a bunch of crooks who are running the pharmaceutical industry ripping us off every single day and Ill tell you something right now in the midst of this epidemic youve got people in the pharmaceutical industry who are saying Oh wow what an opportunity to make a fortune So the word has got to go out I certainly would do this as president You dont worry people of America do not worry about the cost of prescription drugs Do not worry about the cost of the healthcare that youre going to get because we are a nation a civilized democratic society Everybody rich and poor middleclass will get the care they need The drug companies will not rip us off
Joe Biden,What I would do is what we did in our administration I would call a meeting in The Situation Room of all the experts in America dealing with this crisis I would sit them down and I would do exactly what we did then What is it that we need Listen to the experts What do we need With all due respect to Medicare for all you have a singlepayer system in Italy It doesnt work there It has nothing to do with Medicare for all That would not solve the problem at all We can take care of that right now by making sure that no one has to pay for treatment period because of the crisis No one has to pay for whatever drugs are needed period because of the crisis No one has to pay for hospitalization because of the crisis period That is a national emergency and thats how its handled
Joe Biden,It is not working in Italy right now and they have a singlepayer system Now with regard to what else I would do the fact is that were in a position where I would bring together the leading experts in the world instead of doing this in the United States instead of doing this piecemeal sit down and do what we did before with the Ebola crisis What is needed And have one voice one voice like we did every day we met on that crisis in The Situation Room so we lay out overall for all the nation what the best proposal is and how to move forward In the absence of that governors are making some sound decisions Theyre doing the best they can by going out and getting the healthcare experts in their communities and their states to move but it should be directed from the White House from The Situation Room laying out in detail like we did in the Ebola crisis
Bernie Sanders,Well first of all the dysfunctionality of the current healthcare system is obviously apparent As I said earlier there are people who hesitate go to the doctor Youre going to have the maze of regulations Well if this is my income but thats my income can I get it Can I not get it Clearly we are not prepared and Trump only exacerbates the crisis When we spend twice as much per capita on healthcare as any other nation one might expect that we would have enough doctors all over this country One might expect that we would have affordable prescription drugs One might expect that we were preparing effectively for a pandemic that we were ready with the ventilators with the ICUs with the test kits that we need
Bernie Sanders,We are not and bottom line here is in terms of Medicare for all despite what the vice president is saying what the experts tell us is that one of the reasons that we are unprepared and have been unprepared is we dont have a system We got thousands of private insurance plans That is not a system that is prepared to provide healthcare to all people In a good year without the epidemic were losing up to  people who die every year because they dont get to a doctor on time Its clearly this crisis is only making a bad situation worse
Joe Biden,That has nothing to do when youre in a national crisis The national crisis says were responding Its all free You dont have to pay for a thing That has nothing to do with whether or not you have an insurance policy This is a crisis Were at war with the virus Were at war with the virus It has nothing to do with copays or anything We just pass a law saying that you do not have to pay for any of this period
Bernie Sanders,Thats not true As a matter of fact thats not true That law has enormous loopholes I understand that Nancy Pelosi did her best Republicans prevented it What youre
Bernie Sanders,What youre talking about Joe here is enormous loopholes within that that in fact it is not necessarily covering treatment for all people in America and that people are going to be stuck with a bill unless we change that and were going to offer legislation to in fact change that
Joe Biden,If I may I offered legislation I laid out on my plan that it would cover exactly what is not covered by the house I laid out in the plan that I laid out for how we would deal with this crisis Nobody nobody will pay for anything having to do with the crisis This is a national emergency There isnt a question of whether or not this is something that could be covered by insurance or anything else We out of the treasury are going to pay for this Its a national emergency
Bernie Sanders,But the weakness of this is lets just do a hypothetical A family members diagnosed with the virus
Bernie Sanders,Terrible tragedy massive anxiety The wife has the virus The husband is a wreck wants to go to a psychologist wants to get counseling doesnt have the money to do that Maybe their kid breaks a leg They dont have the money to go to healthcare So youre saying right now in the middle of a crisis but you know what Last year at least  people died in America because they didnt get healthcare when they should because we dont have universal coverage I think thats a crisis One out of five people in America cannot afford the prescription drugs they need They suffer Some die I consider that a crisis Bottom line is we need a simple system which exists in Canada exists in countries all over the world and that is if you are an American you get the healthcare you need end of discussion We can save huge sums of money doing that The trick is do we have the guts to take on the healthcare industry some of which is funding the vice presidents campaign Do we have the courage to take on the executives at the prescription drug industry
Bernie Sanders,some of whom are funding his campaign
Joe Biden,Look this is a national crisis I dont want to get this into a back and forth in terms of our politics here Ive laid out a plan building on Obamacare providing a public option of Medicare that would cover everyone the same way This idea that this is his only answer is a mistaken notion but regardless of whether my plan was in place or his this is a crisis This is like we are being attacked from abroad This is something that is of great consequence This is like a war and in a war you do whatever is needed to be done to take care of your people and what you do is you and I have proposed it and laid it out in detail everything that you need in terms of dealing with this crisis would be free It is paid for by the taxpayers generally generally It has nothing to do with Bernies Medicare for all By the way the
Bernie Sanders,Well I think we use all of the tools that make sense If using the National Guard which is folks I think in New York state are already using the National Guard that is something that has to be done This is clearly as the vice president indicated a national emergency What I worry about is not only how we respond aggressively to the virus but also how we respond aggressively to the economic fallout of a global recession
Bernie Sanders,Right now in Illinois and Ohio if my memory is correct the governor there has said theyre closing down bars Theyre closing down restaurants What happens to the workers who are there What happens to the millions of workers who may end up losing their jobs What I think we have got to do right now is if Trump can provide or the fed can provide a trillion and a half for liquidity for the banks what weve got to say to every worker in America you know what Dont panic Youre not going to  Youll be able to pay your mortgage because youre going to get a check
Bernie Sanders,Youre going to be made whole
Joe Biden,The answer is I would call out the military
Joe Biden,Now They have the capacity to provide this surge help that hospitals need and that is needed across the nation I would make sure that they did exactly what theyre prepared to do Theyve done it They did it in the Ebola crisis Theyve done it They have the capacity to build bed hospitals and tents that are completely safe and secure and provide the help to get it done to anybody this overflow So it is a national emergency I would call out the military
Bernie Sanders,Well the Ebola crisis is one thing This is obviously a pandemic which is far more severe and impactful to this country I think one of the things that we want to remember here is that we got a lot of elderly people in this country who are told stay home Dont leave your house Whos going to get food to them How do we get food to them Youve got schools all over this country now being shut down Okay How are we going to make sure that the kids do well in this crisis not become traumatized What do we do about the parents now who have to stay home with the kids and cant go to work
Bernie Sanders,I think what bottom line here is that in this crisis we have got to start paying attention to the most vulnerable that includes people who are in prison right now people who are in homeless shelters right now What about the half a million people who are homeless tonight Whos going to respond to them Now in  when we had the Wall Street bailout they did very well for the people on top They bailed out the crooks on Wall Street but they forgot about the suffering of ordinary Americans This time around let us learn that lesson Let us pay attention to the working families in this country
Bernie Sanders,We have the most vulnerable
Joe Biden,We have learned that lesson and again I lay out in detail What we should be doing now is we should be surging help to those places which are the most vulnerable We should have every single person thats in a nursing home being able to be tested We should be moving forces in to do that We should move in the capability to do that We should be sitting down the president should be sitting down in The Situation Room right now and doing what we did before and asking the question Okay youre going to close everything Well if you close everything how do you get prescriptions that have to be filled How do you make sure when you close that school those children are going to be able to get the school food program How do you make sure that youre going to be able to see to it that you get your mortgage paid I propose that all of that be covered and its going to take a multimultibillion dollar program to do that But first things first the first thing is take care of the immediate needs we have now relating to surging the kind
Joe Biden,Take care of the immediate needs we have now relating to surging the kind of capability we have to prevent this great bump in terms of how its going to cause such pain as well as moving in the direction of making sure we have a longterm plan to make sure its taken care
Bernie Sanders,Well one of the consequences is we have got to learn that you cannot lie to the American people You cannot be less than frank about the nature of the crisis And what bothers me very much is you have a president of the United States today Mr Trump who was praising China for the good work that they are doing when in fact as you indicated they were lying to their own people and allowing that inaudible  the case Look I dont think this is the time for recrimination to be punishing people Now is the time by the way to be working with China They are learning a lot about this crisis and in fact we have got to work with them Weve got to work with the World Health Organization Weve got to work with Italy Weve got to work with countries around the world If there was ever a moment when the entire world is in this together got to support each other this is that moment
Joe Biden,If I may respond Thats why I insisted the moment this broke out that we should insist on having our experts in China in China to see what was happening and make it clear to China thered be consequences if we did not have that access We have to lead the world We should be the ones doing what we did during the Ebola crisis bringing the whole world together and saying This is what we must do We have to have a common plan All nations are affected the same way by this virus depending on exposure And so this is we need world leadership We need international leadership We need someone who knows how to bring the world together and insist on fundamental change in the way in which were approaching this
Bernie Sanders,Well the bottom line here is that in the midst of this crisis we have got to act in an unprecedented way And that means every country on earth is going to be affected Every country on earth has got to work together It also means that we tell the pharmaceutical industry we tell the big money interests that this is not a time for profiteering This is a time for all of us working together The World Health Organization is a very very strong organization It is sad that we have a President that has ignored the international community in so many ways including in terms of international health crisis
Joe Biden,What I would do is make it clear to the world and make it clear to the United States that we are going to have to have a major major major bailout package that we do not reward corporations we reward individuals who in fact are really put to the test here The problem is the policies of this administration economically have Weve eaten a lot of our seed corn here The ability for us to use levers that were available before have been used up by this godawful tax cut of  trillion By the fact that we have used The fed will be of little consequence now theyve already used what leverage they have and so were going to have to just level with the American people
Joe Biden,Heres the deal Were going to have to not only deal with the immediate crisis economic crisis which is the most critical now to let people know their mortgages are going to be paid their rents are going to be paid theyre going to have childcare theyre going to make sure that all their medical bills are cared for relating to this et cetera We have to go beyond that Were going to have to be in a situation where were meeting on a daily basis like we did in the middle of the financial crisis to decide how we are going to find the wherewithal and the money to be able to see to it We hold all these folks harmless But not do what Trump wants to do For example he came along and said I got a great idea Lets Well youre going to tell me
Bernie Sanders,The Ebola crisis in my view exposes the dysfunctionality of our healthcare system and how poorly prepared we are despite how much money that we spent The Ebola crisis is also I think exposing the cruelty and the unjustness of our economy today We have more income and wealth inequality in America today than any time in  years And what that means then in the midst of this crisis You know if youre a multimillionaire no ones happy about this crisis Youre going to get through it Youre going to get everything you need Youre not worried about healthcare Youre not worried about income coming in
Bernie Sanders,Half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck We got people who are struggling working two or three jobs to put food on the table What is going to happen to them So the lesson to be learned is we have got to move aggressively right now to address the economic crisis as a result of Ebola Keep talking about Ebola You got Ebola in my head here right now As a result of the virus here the Coronavirus What we have got to do also is understand the fragility of the economy and how unjust and unfair it is that so few have so much and so many have so little
Joe Biden,People are looking for results not a revolution They want to deal with the results they need right now and we can do that by making sure that we make everybody whole who has been so badly hurt in terms of they lose their job in terms of not having the ability to care for their children in terms of the healthcare costs that they have related to this crisis We can make them whole now now and put in process a system whereby they all are made whole
Joe Biden,That has nothing to do with a legitimate concern about income equality in America Thats real Thats real But that does not affect the need for us to act swiftly and very thoroughly and in concert with all the forces that we need to bring to bear to deal with the crisis now so no ones thrown out of their home no one loses their mortgage no one is kicked out of their house no one loses their paycheck no one is in a position where they have a significant financial disability as a consequence of this SARS Of this particular crisis
Bernie Sanders,Well I think it goes without saying that as a nation we have to respond as forcefully as we can to the current crisis but it is not good enough not to be understanding how we got here and where we want to go into the future So how does it happen that today in the wealthiest country in the history of the world half of our people are scared to death Good I agree In fact that was my idea originally to make sure that every person in this country is made whole as a result of this crisis But God willing this crisis is going to end and we are going to have to develop an economy in which half of our people are not living paycheck to paycheck and struggling to put food on the table
Joe Biden,I dont disagree with that You were asking about the crisis what are we going to do about the crisis now Which is incredibly consequential to millions and millions of Americans And its not going to be policy now Its not going to be solved by a change in how we deal with healthcare Its got to be solved with an emergency need right now Right now what do we do First thing we do is we make sure that healthcare is available by us having the tools to be able to deal with it and that requires us to go out and do much more than this president has done in terms of planning Secondly it requires us to be in a position where were anticipating what will happen in the next month or weeks in terms of the flow into the healthcare system by bringing the military along more hospital beds more training more equipment more equipment to save the first responders as well
Joe Biden,In addition to that we then have to also look at what are the immediate needs right today How about that person whos been laid off today How about that person who doesnt have an income today They have to know that tomorrow when the paycheck comes due you will get that paycheck And thirdly we have to think longterm about how we deal with making all those who have been badly damaged right again and then we move on Then we move on to change the economy in ways that are more profoundly necessary than people think but do not respond to the immediate needs we have now First things first
Bernie Sanders,I did Youre quite right I voted against the bailout because I believed that the illegal behavior being done by the people on Wall Street should not be rewarded by a bailout And today by the way those banks are more prosperous and own more assets by and large than they did back then Theyre bigger now than they were then I thought at the time that in the midst of massive income and wealth inequality the people on top there was surtax on the very wealthy should bail out And its not just the top bailout We gave trillions of dollars in zero interest loans to large banks
Bernie Sanders,But to answer your question where we are right now we need to stabilize the economy but we cant repeat what we did in  Joe voted for that I voted against it Because we have got to do more than save the banks or the oil companies Our job right now is to tell every working person in this country no matter what your income is you are not going to suffer as a result of this crisis of which you had no control
Joe Biden,Had those banks all gone under all those people Bernie says he cares about would be in deep trouble Deep deep trouble All those little folks wed have gone out of business theyd find themselves in the position where they would lose everything that they had in that bank whether it was  or  or a savings account This was about saving an economy and it did save the economy and the banks paid back and they paid back with interest I agree with Bernie some of them should have gone to jail That was the big disagreement I had in terms of bailing out but the question was they paid back In addition to that also part of that was bailing out the automobile industry saving thousands of jobs tens of thousands of jobs over time He voted against that as well
Bernie Sanders,No I did not vote against that That bailout money was used later on by Bush to protect the automobile industry But heres the point
Bernie Sanders,one minute one minute Heres the point here is that in terms of that bailout there are ways that you can bail out When you have a handful of people who have incredible wealth who have prospered off of the illegal behavior of individuals in this case on Wall Street you know what you say to them And I did I said this to the Secretary of the Treasury You want a bailout Thats fine You have your friends pay for it not working people The other point is as Joe should know it wasnt just the  billion TARP program The fed gave trillions and trillions of dollars in zero interest loans to every financial institution in this country and central banks all over the world That was essentially a grant because they then could sell that They can then bring in interest rates much greater than the zero interest loans that they got
Joe Biden,Look the fact of the matter is that if in fact the banks had all gone under we would be in a great depression How do you get out of that Now Bernies saying that I guess hes going to do a wealth tax or something that the top  could pay for everything and they should pay for everything that occurred We were talking about tens and hundreds of billions of dollars Thats what this was about And the fact was that it saved the economy from going into a depression after we passed the Recovery Act which I was the one went on got the three votes to get it changed that had  billion in it and was the thing that kept us from going into a great depression
Joe Biden,Anyone who shows up to be tested for Coronavirus or gets Coronavirus treated would be held harmless Just like Ive argued all along Any woman who crosses the border or is here and being beaten by her husband but shes an undocumented she cannot be deported because she reports There are certain things you cannot deport an undocumented person for and that would be one of them We want that Its in the interests of everyone And those folks who are the xenophobic folks out there its even in their interest that that woman come forward or that man come forward because it deals with keeping the spread from moving more rapidly They will not should not under any circumstances be held accountable and be deported for that purpose period
Bernie Sanders,I have been criticized because the proposal for Medicare for All that I introduced includes making sure that undocumented people are also covered And right now we have the absurd situation where undocumented people who try to do the right thing theyre sick they want to go to the doctor they dont want to spread this disease are now standing and thinking about whether ICE is going to deport them So one of the things that we have to do is to make sure that everybody feels comfortable getting the healthcare that they need That should be a general principle above and beyond the Coronavirus
Bernie Sanders,Second of all weve got to end these terrible ICE raids which are terrorizing communities all over this country And thirdly to answer your question the time is long overdue for this country to move to comprehensive immigration reform and a path towards citizenship for those  million undocumented And furthermore on day one as President I would restore the legal status of the  million young people crosstalk
Bernie Sanders,Well a great deal I mean last night we had a fireside chat not a rally I love doing rallies and we bring many thousands of people out to our rallies I enjoy it very much Were not doing that right now In fact our entire staff is working from home So on a personal level what were doing is Im not shaking hands Joe and I did not shake hands I am very careful about the people I am interacting with Im using a lot of soap and hand sanitizers to make sure that I do not get the infection And I have to say thank God right now I do not have any symptoms and I feel very grateful for that
Joe Biden,Well fortunately I dont have any of the underlying conditions you talked about that I have to worry about number one Number two thank God for the time being anything can happen as my mother would say knock on wood that Im in good health Number three Im taking all the precautions anyone would take whether theyre  years old or  years old or  years old That is Im going to make sure that I do not shake hands any longer I do not engage We did the same thing Our staff is all working from home We are not doing rallies any longer Were doing virtual rallies Were doing virtual town hall meetings
Joe Biden,Were in a situation where now I do not as I said when we encounter people were not going into crowds And so Im taking all the precautions everyone else should be taking I wash my hands God knows how many times a day with hot water and soap I carry with me as a matter of fact I have it in my bag outside here hand sanitizer I dont know how many times a day I use that I make sure I dont touch my face and so on So Im taking all the precautions weve told everybody else to take
Joe Biden,We have problems we have to solve now Now Whats a revolution going to do disrupt everything in the meantime Look the Senator talks about his Medicare For All He still hasnt told you how hes going to ever get it past He hasnt told you how in fact theres any possibility of that happening He hadnt told you how much its going to cost He hadnt tell you how its going to apply It doesnt kick in for four years even after it passes We want a revolution Lets act now Pass the Biden healthcare plan which takes Obamacare restores all the cuts made to it Subsidize it further Provide for lower drug prices Make sure that theres no hidden bills Make sure that we invest what I want to invest  billion in dealing with underlying diseases that are of great consequence diabetes Alzheimers and cancer
Joe Biden,Make sure that we have a Medicare option thats in a public option providing Medicare for us We can do that now I can get that passed I can get that done if Im President of the United States of America That will be a fundamental change and it happens now I can tell you from experience being a significant consumer of healthcare with my sons my family all the things weve gone through what people want is hope And they need it now not four years from now Bernie still hasnt told us how hes going to pay for it
Joe Biden,Were talking about a plus trillion plan
Bernie Sanders,Look lets do something that is very rarely done in the Congress Lets do something that the media does Lets talk about the reality of American life Why is it that over the last  years despite the huge increase in productivity and technology the average worker todays making a nickel more in real dollars Why is it that over the last  years the richest  have seen a  trillion increase in their wealth bottom half of America  billion decline in their wealth
Bernie Sanders,The bottom half of America  billion decline in their wealth Why is it that we are the only major country on Earth not to guarantee healthcare to all people as a human right Why are we the only major country not to have paid medical and family leave Why do we give tax breaks to billionaires when a halfamillion people are homeless today And it comes down to something Jake we dont talk about The power structure in America who has the power Ill tell you who has the power Its the people who contribute money The billionaires who contribute money to political campaigns who control the legislative agenda Those people have the power
Bernie Sanders,If you want to make real changes in this country if you want to create an economy that works for all not just the few if you want to guarantee quality healthcare to all not make  billion in profit for the healthcare industry you know what you need You need to take on Wall Street You need to take on the drug companies and the insurance companies and the fossil fuel industry You dont take campaign contributions from them You take them on and create an economy that works for all
Joe Biden,You want to do that Do what I proposed over  years ago federally fund all elections My whole healthcare plan by changing the way in which we deal with capital gains People should pay their capital gains based on what their income tax is and not at  That would raise  billion to pay for my entire medical healthcare plan which would cover everyone
Joe Biden,The fact of the matter is everything I call for I pay for And I do not believe and I have not supported these exorbitant tax cuts for the wealthy I strongly opposed the tax cut that this president has put through of  trillion  billion I said at the time this was all about trying to eliminate the safety net
Joe Biden,Look the idea that Bernie implies the way he says things speaking of negative ads My lord Bernie youre running ads saying Im opposed to Social Security The PolitiFact says its a flat lie and that the Washington Post said is a flat lie
Bernie Sanders,Oh well Let me ask you a question Joe
Bernie Sanders,Have you been on the floor of the Senate You were in the Senate for a few years
Bernie Sanders,Time and time again talking about the necessity with pride about cutting Social Security cutting Medicare cutting veterans programs
Bernie Sanders,All right America go to the website right now Go to the YouTube right now Time after time you were not a fan of BowlesSimpson
Bernie Sanders,You were not a fan of the balanced budget amendment which called for cuts in Social Security Come on Joe you were
Bernie Sanders,Youre an honest guy Why dont you just tell the truth here We all make mistakes
Joe Biden,I am telling the truth You said that I in fact Why am I rated  by the Social Security organizations Why am I viewed as a strong
Joe Biden,I have laid out how I will increase Social Security benefits
Bernie Sanders,Thats good I laid that out
Joe Biden,I have laid out how I am going to make sure that it is in fact paid for
Joe Biden,Go to joebidencom Look at my exchange with Paul Ryan on his desire to try to privatize andor cut Social Security and understand how he manipulated it
Bernie Sanders,All right Joe let me repeat it again I want you just to be straight with the American people I am saying that you have been on the floor of the Senate time and time again talking about the need to cut Social Security Medicare and veterans programs Is that true or is that not true
Joe Biden,That is not true What is true is in terms of the negotiations that are taking place how to deal with the deficit Everything was on the table I did not support any of those cuts and Social Security or in veterans benefits
Bernie Sanders,Whoa Whoa Whoa Everything was on the table All right youre right You just said it Including in your judgment cuts to Social Security and veterans
Joe Biden,In order to get the kinds of changes we need on other things related but we did not cut it I did not vote for it
Bernie Sanders,I know because people like me helped stop that But Joe you just contradict
Bernie Sanders,Joe you just contradicted yourself One minute Excuse me One minute you said I was not on the floor The next minute you say Well yes there was a reason why I was worried about the deficit Maybe thats good reason maybe its not All that I am saying is you were prepared to cut and advocated for the cuts of programs
Joe Biden,Lets just I did not I never voted to cut Social Security
Bernie Sanders,Im not talking about voting Joe Thats not what I said
Joe Biden,I never voted Well look I voted to protect it Just go look at the debate with Paul Ryan for the vice presidency Look at what I did And Bernie will you acknowledge your campaign took out of context that whole exchange between Paul Ryan Are you saying PolitiFact is wrong Are you saying
Bernie Sanders,Yeah Well believe me the Washington Post PolitiFact is wrong a whole lot of times
Joe Biden,Are they wrong on that Bernie Are they wrong on that Bernie
Bernie Sanders,Joe did you Wait a minute Ill answer your question You answer mine
Bernie Sanders,One more time Were you on the floor time and time again for whatever reason talking about the need to cut Social Security and Medicare and veterans programs
Joe Biden,No I did not talk about the need to cut any of those programs
Bernie Sanders,Okay All that I would say to the American people go to YouTube Its all over the place Joe said it many many times Im surprised You can defend it or change your mind on it but you cant deny the reality
Bernie Sanders,Incremental adjustments are what I advocated Adjustments that I advocated and have advocated for years is among other things increasing the cost of living assistance No youre not going to find me ever calling for cuts to Social Security Right now for example we determine COLAs by looking at inflation for the general population rather than segregating the higher costs that seniors are paying for prescription drugs and for healthcare Thats what I was talking about
Bernie Sanders,I have in fact when Joe and others were enamored with the socalled BowlesSimpson effort which included cuts to Social Security or raising the retirement age I formed along with people like Barbara Boxer the defending Social Security caucus to say no when  of our seniors who are trying to get by on  a year or more we are not going to cut Social Security
Joe Biden,Two things Number one lets talk about the Bankruptcy Bill The Bankruptcy Bill was passing overwhelmingly and I improved it I had a choice It was going to pass and a Republican president Republican Congress I offered two amendments to make sure that people under  would not be affected and women and children would go to the front of the line on alimony and support payments Thats what I did It passed overwhelmingly I did not like the rest of the bill But I improved it number one
Joe Biden,Number two Ive talked with Senator Warren about her proposal This is the first opportunity weve had to make substantial change in what we couldnt get done in a Republican administration Thats why we talked last two nights ago and I supported her proposal Its a good proposal its a solid proposal She should get credit for having introduced it
Joe Biden,With regard to what were talking about in terms of college education Ive been saying for a long time that were in a position where  years of education is not enough is not enough for the st century We need  years of education The exact bill that Senator Sanders introduced I guess a little over a year ago capping it off at  in income You could get free up to that point After that youd have to pay for your college education It only worked for public schools and it would work for public universities in your state I support that idea It was a good idea and I support it Thats what it is Im not saying everything Bernies said has been wrong he happens to be right on that one
Bernie Sanders,Look this is a little bit about leadership as well Joe talked about bankruptcy Joe if my memory is correct you helped write that Bankruptcy Bill
Bernie Sanders,That Bankruptcy Bill By the way when we talk about education we got  million people in America struggling with student debt some of them really struggling with student debt That Bankruptcy Bill made it impossible very difficult for people to escape from that student debt It was a very very bad bill You said Joe that a majority of the people in the Senate voted for it Youre right
Bernie Sanders,Overwhelmingly Well I voted against it in the House and I was right I dont have to rethink my position because thats what leadership is about Having the guts to take an unpopular vote But its not just bankruptcy The difference between Joe and I on higher education is four years ago it was not a popular idea Joe Glad youre coming around now Four years ago when I said that public colleges and universities should be tuition free people were saying Bernie thats a radical idea Well you got states and cities and counties all over the country that are moving in that direction
Bernie Sanders,Im glad that Joe was on board But what leadership is about is going forward when its not popular when its an idea that you get criticized for So Im proud of that fact and Im proud of my leadership on many issues Joe since the campaign has come around I talked about raising that minimum wage bucksanhour four years ago Joe
Joe Biden,So did I and I went out and campaigned for it
Joe Biden,an hour in New York city Go to the Governor
Bernie Sanders,I will talk to the Governor I am not aware of it I am not aware of it
Bernie Sanders,All right Four years ago it was a radical idea Very few people in Congress were talking about it
Joe Biden,Well here look Lets get something straight about the Bankruptcy Bill The Bankruptcy Bill already It did not affect student debt for  because the law had already been passed You could not declare bankruptcy for those loans that were from private institutions You couldnt do it as the Bankruptcy Bill did not affect that It affected  of the people the first Bankruptcy Bill  of the student loans number one
Joe Biden,Number two Now were in a position where were able to correct that problem The fact is if I hadnt stepped up and changed the law as it relates to people making less than  those who for alimony and child support then guess what They would have been in the bucket too It was going to pass anyway I made it Let me finish I made incrementally better I did not like the bill I did not support the bill And I made it clear to the industry I didnt like the bill
Joe Biden,Number two this bill now calls for the opportunity to fundamentally change the mistakes we couldnt correct in the bill the first time around That is why I support Elizabeth Warrens idea and its a very good idea
Bernie Sanders,Well this is kind of circular logic Were going to reform the bill that I voted for Well if you hadnt voted for it and if you rallied other people as I tried to do in the House voting against it we might not have the problems with it we have today What leadership is about Joe it deals whether your opposition or your support I should say for legislation regarding gay communities and the socalled Defense of Marriage Act You remember that bill right You remember
Bernie Sanders,Gay marriage today is considered a little bit differently than it was  years ago I remember that vote It was a very hard vote I voted against the Defense of Marriage Act You voted for it I voted against the Bankruptcy Bill You voted for it I voted against the war in Iraq which was also a tough vote You voted for I voted against disastrous trade agreements like NAFTA and PNT all with China which costs this country over four million good paying jobs You voted for it I voted against the Hyde Amendment which denies low income women the right to get an abortion You have consistently voted for it I dont know what your position is on it today but you have consistently voted for it In other words all that Im saying here we can argue about the merits of the bill
Bernie Sanders,It takes courage sometimes to do the right thing
Joe Biden,We can argue about the past and the future This man voted against the Brady Bill five times Background checks background checks Five times number one Number two this man is the only one of the few Democrats I know who voted to exempt the gun industry from being able to be sued Talk about a special special interest We should be able to sue drug companies We should be able to sue tobacco companies We cannot sue the gun manufacturers because he voted for that years ago He says it was a mistake now Im prepared to accept he says its a mistake
Joe Biden,The question is what do we do from this point on And by the way I might add Im the first person to go on national television in any administration and say I supported gay marriage I supported gay marriage when asked It started a ripple effect for gay marriage on national television
Bernie Sanders,We could argue this or that bill But what Im suggesting is that in this time of crisis when we live in a really really unsettling world economically from a healthcare prospective with the coronavirus the people of America know my record Okay
Bernie Sanders,For  years I have stood with the working families of this country I have taken on every special interest there is out there and that is what I will do in the White House Thats a very different record than Joes
Joe Biden,That is not a different record than mine
Bernie Sanders,That is a totally different record than yours All right I mean its manifested in this campaign when youre getting all this money from wealthy people and billionaires I think if you want somebody who will take to the White House what I have done for my whole life
Bernie Sanders,And that is take on special interest I think Im that candidate
Joe Biden,The average campaign contribution
Joe Biden,Hes making it hard for me right now I was trying to give him credit for some things He wont even take the credit for things he wants to do Look I think that I want to make it clear that Bernie as a nominee I will not only support him I will campaign for him I believe the people who support me will do the same thing Because the existential threat to the United States of America is Donald Trump Its critical I would hope that Bernie would do the same thing if I am the nominee and encourage all of his followers to in fact support me as well Because its much bigger than either of us Character of the nation is on the ballot It goes well beyond whether or not Senator Sanders and I both agree we need medic healthcare should be a right not a privilege We both agree we have to deal with student debt We both agree we have to deal with education and access to education We both agree that we have a new Green Deal to deal with the existential threat that faces humanity We disagree on the detail of how we do it but we dont disagree on the principle We fundamentally disagree with this president on everything This is a man who wants to cut Social Security cut Medicare Not Bernie the President of the United States So this is much bigger than whether or not Im the nominee or Bernies the nominee We must defeat Donald Trump He is the Four more years of Donald Trump will fundamentally change the nature of who we are as a nation Weve got to restore this countrys soul thats essential As long as this president is there were not going to be able to that
Bernie Sanders,Can I just say a word then Ill respond to you
Bernie Sanders,On day one when I announced my candidacy what I said is This country cannot deal with a president who is a pathological liar was running a corrupt administration or obviously doesnt know the Constitution of the United States who believes hes above law was a racist and a sexist and a homophobe He is the most dangerous president in the modern history of this country
Bernie Sanders,What I said on day one Joe day one that obviously I hope to win the nomination But if I dont win the nomination I and I think every other Democratic candidate is prepared to come together to do everything humanly possible to defeat Donald Trump
Bernie Sanders,But let me respond to something that Joe said We talk about the Green New Deal and all of these things in general terms but details make a difference What I have said throughout this campaign and I dont think Ive heard you say this yet Joe is that if were going to save this planet for our kids and future generations we need to have the courage to take on the greed of the fossil fuel industry and make it clear to them that their shortterm profits are not more important than the future of this planet We have a very detailed planet a detailed proposal Happy to get the endorsement of the Sunrise Movement
Bernie Sanders,My Cabinet my administration will look like America last I heard over half of the people in America are women and that will be the representation in my Cabinet and my administration And in terms of policies unlike Joe I have consistently believed and I have a  lifetime voting record from groups like NARAL that it is a womens right to control her own body not the government I have believed that we have got to move aggressively to deal with domestic violence in this country I have aggressively and I think effectively made the case that we cannot have women in America earning  cents on the dollar compared to men And if youre a minority woman its  or  cents on the dollar
Bernie Sanders,We need to have universal affordable highquality childcare so women who are single or married can go off to work and know that their kids are going to be well taken care of So I think if you look at my agenda which is on berniesanderscom what you will find it is a very strong agenda in fighting for the rights of women who today are under incredible political assault by Trump and Republican governors all across this country
Joe Biden,Yes thank you Number one I agree with the question and the underlying premise of Amys question Number one I commit it that if Im elected President and have an opportunity to appoint someone to the courts Ill appoint the first black woman to the courts Its required that they have representation now its long overdue Secondly if Im elected President my Cabinet my administration will look like the country And I commit that Ill pick a woman to be Vice President There are a number of women who are qualified to be President tomorrow I would pick a woman to be my Vice President
Joe Biden,Number three Im the guy that wrote the domestic violence law and Im the guy that put in the prohibitions that no one who abuses someone else should be able to own a gun period They should not be able to own a gun I would get the boyfriend exception amended now Ive gotten it past that If you are to get a stay away order from a court you have a child with someone that you cannot own a gun No one should be able in a gun who has abused a woman period
Bernie Sanders,and ask Joe a question Right now a womans right to control her own body is under massive assault unprecedented assault
Bernie Sanders,Joe you have in the past on more than one occasion voted for the Hyde Amendment which says that a woman lowincome woman could not use Medicaid funding for an abortion Is that still your view or have you modified it
Joe Biden,It is not my view It is not my view and by the way everybody whos been in the Congress voted for the Hyde Amendment at one point or another because it was locked in other bills The reason why I affirmatively came out opposed to the Hyde Amendment was that if were going to have public funding for all healthcare along the line there is no way you could allow for there to be a requirement that you have Hyde Amendment a woman who doesnt have the money could not have coverage under healthcare
Joe Biden,Number two And I did that a while ago okay Number one Number two I would send immediately to the desk of the United States Congress when Im elected President if Im elected President a codification of Roe V Wade amended by Casey because I think it is a womans right to choose I think its a womans opportunity to be able to make that decision And in fact Ive gotten a  rating from NARAL as well
Bernie Sanders,Excuse me you have a lifetime  voting record from NARAL
Joe Biden,I know my record of late from NARAL has been  I dont know whether it was  years ago
Bernie Sanders,Well all right I mean I think one of the differences not to pick a bone here is I have been consistent Ive always believed in that and you have not Im glad youve changed your views
Bernie Sanders,In all likelihood I will For me its not just nominating a woman It is making sure that we have a progressive women and there are progressive women out there so my very strong tendency is to move in that direction
Joe Biden,Number one I said that it took much too long to get it right and the President did get it right by DACA as well as making sure that it tried to protect parents as well and by the way moving on an immigration bill as well The fact is that we already had a vote on immigration bill by the way and Bernie voted against it the immigration bill Had he voted forward and had passed wed already have  million undocumented would be citizens as I speak right now But I will send to the desk immediately a bill that requires access to citizenship for  million undocumented folks number one Number two the first hundred days of my administration no one no one will be deported at all From that point on the only deportations that will take place are commissions of felonies in the United States of America
Joe Biden,Is its about uniting families Its about making sure that we can both be a nation of immigrants as well as a nation that is decent
Bernie Sanders,Let me respond and Ill answer your question Let me respond to Joes comments about the  immigration bill That bill was opposed by LULAC the largest Latino organization in America The Southern Poverty Law Center called its guestworker programs akin to slavery There wasnt really a vote on the bill It was killed because there was a vote on the Dorgan amendment I think it was  And you know who voted with me on that one Joe Barack Obama He understood that that proposal was a bad idea We dont need slavery in America where workers guestworkers are forced to say with their employers
Bernie Sanders,But in terms of immigration in general let me outline some of the things that we do Day one we restore the legal status of  million young people and their parents in the DACA program Number two immediately we end these ICE raids which are terrorizing communities all over this country Three we changed the border policy under my administration no federal agent will ever grab little babies from the arms of their mothers And fourth I think we can pass what the American people want and that is comprehensive immigration reform path towards citizenship for the  million undocumented
Bernie Sanders,No Thats just I mean thats what Trump says and that is a total lie What were talking about is a humane sensible policy supported by the American people Nobody is talking about open borders and of course Trump lies about that But the bottom line is right now you have in this country people who have been here for decades they are working hard theyre raising their kids They are an important part of our agricultural economy our construction economy These are good people and yet they are living in terror and we have got to end that terror and end the ICE raids and move toward a path towards citizenship
Joe Biden,Let me set the record straight on something what was said You know the idea that it was slavery Barack Obama supported that immigration bill Teddy Kennedy supported that immigration bill I supported it I doubt whether those people think its slavery And by the way right after his vote against that he went on the Lou Dobbs show and continued to canard that theyre taking jobs These immigrants are taking jobs from Americans which is one of the Republican canards right after that no vote And so come on this is You think Ted Kennedy is for slavery You think I was for slavery You think people voted for it for slavery
Joe Biden,And with regard to your question relative to whether or not I would deal with supporting the border Look we can deal with securing the border by national technical means All the bad things are coming through ports of entry right now we dont need a wall And by the way I would immediately as President surge to the border I would end this notion for the first time in history that people seeking asylum have to be in squalor on the other side of the river in a desperate situation They should be able to come to the United States and have a judgment made is whether or not they qualify I would also surge to the border immigration judges to make decisions immediately and no one no one would be put in jail while waiting for their hearing
Bernie Sanders,Thats kind of what Ive been saying throughout the entire campaign
Bernie Sanders,So what we need is at the border hundreds of administrative judges We need to deal with people who are seeking asylum based on international law We need not to be dividing children from their parents and dividing families up We need a humane border policy And Ill tell you what else we need and I speak as the son of an immigrant My father came to this country from Poland at the age of  without a nickel in his pocket couldnt speak English didnt have much of an education I will end on day one the demonization the ugly demonization from the White House of the immigrant community in this country Weve got a President who is trying to divide us up My administration brings our people together black and white and Latino Native American Asian American
Bernie Sanders,Of course not Look And one of the things that goes on when you have that process is that not only the psychological terror and Ive talked to these kids kids are scared to death in America when they come home from school that their mom or dad may not be there may be deported What we need to do is to end and I will end this on day one the ICE raids that have been so harmful to so many people And we need to do again what the American people want us to do Im the son of an immigrant This is a country significantly built by immigrant labor built by slave labor and what we have got to do is appreciate each other and end this demonization and the divisiveness this coming from the Trump administration
Joe Biden,Can I add one thing to that please
Joe Biden,Look we are a nation of immigrants our future rests upon the Latino community being fully integrated  out of every  children in school today from kindergarten through high school is a Latino right now today The idea that any American thinks it doesnt pay for us to significantly invest in their future is absolutely a bizarre notion because if we do not invest everything that the very wealthy are concerned about and the xenophobes are concerned about will in fact get worse not better We should be embracing bringing them in just like what happened with the Irish immigrants after the famine just what happened with the Italians et cetera Weve been through this before xenophobia is a disease
Bernie Sanders,Well of course we do I mean we Look this is what the scientists are telling us the same scientists who make your point there Jake What theyre telling us is if we dont get our act together in the next seven or eight years there would be irreversible damage done to this planet Were talking about cities in America from Miami to New Orleans to Charleston South Carolina being underwater We are talking about severe droughts which will prevent farmers in the Midwest from growing the food that we need Were talking about extreme weather disturbances which hit Houston Texas Venice Italy just a few months ago
Bernie Sanders,We are talking about the absolute need and I want to hear Joes position on this This is not a middle of the ground thing This is not building a few more solar panels or a few more wind turbines What this is about is transforming our energy system as quickly as we humanly can away from fossil fuel It is insane that we continue to have fracking in America It is absurd that we give tens of billions of dollars a year in tax breaks and subsidies to the fossil fuel industry This has got the end and end now if we love our kids and future generations
Joe Biden,First thing that President Obama and I were summoned to the State Department Excuse me the Defense Department for was to meet with all the chiefs the single greatest threat to our national security they said is climate change Single greatest threat to our national security because as populations have to move because they can no longer live where they are because their islands are sinking because you saw what happened in Darfur with the change in weather patterns and the deserted there It causes war it causes great migrations great migrations They said thats the single biggest problem Number two theres an awful lot of people today who are in fact getting ill because of the changes in the environment particularly up where Bernie lives Im not It has nothing to do with him But having up in the Northeast because you have everything from beetle infestation and a whole range of things that are causing diseases as well in addition to eliminating foliage But
Joe Biden,Yes it is ambitious enough to tackle the crisis because what Go to joebidencom I lay out the first  things I would do immediately upon being elected Number one were going to once again reinstate all the cuts the President made and everything from the cafe standards how far automobiles can go investing in light rail so that we take cars off the road making sure were in a position where we are now in a position that we put  charging stations in areas that silence   all new highways that we built making sure that we spent  billion a year silence  and the federal government paying for transportation the vehicles we run all of those being converted to being able to run on low carbon fuel andor be able to run on no carbon fuel at all by having them move into a direction that is all carbon free We can do these things We can lay down the tracks where nothing can be changed by the next President or the following President the one beyond that
Joe Biden,In addition to that we also have to I would immediately rejoin the Paris climate accord which I helped put together I would call the  nations over a hundred nations but the hundred major polluters to the United States and the first hundred days to up the ante and make it clear that in fact if they didnt thered be a price to pay And lastly I would be right now organizing the hemisphere and the world to provide  billion for the Amazon for Brazil no longer to burn the Amazon so they could have forests Theyre no longer forests but they could have farming and say This is what were going to do  the region is burning out than we admit in one entire year per year
Bernie Sanders,All well and good but nowhere near enough I mean you mentioned we started this debate talking about a warlike situation in terms of the coronavirus and we said We have to act accordingly You said it I think youre right I said it We have to act dramatically boldly if were going to save lives in this country and around the world I look at climate change in exactly the same way Its not a question of reentering the Paris Accord Thats fine Who cares Its not a big deal The deal right now is do we have the courage And this gets back to the point Im trying to make all night long Do we take on the healthcare industry and tell them their profits are not more important than healthcare for all Do we take on the fossil fuel industry
Bernie Sanders,Look in terms of the fossil fuel industry these guys have been lying theyve been lying for years like the tobacco industry lied  years ago Oh we dont know if fossil fuels if oil and carbon emissions are causing climate change They knew ExxonMobil knew they lied In fact I think they should be held criminally accountable But this Jake is an issue of enormous consequence What Joe was saying goes nowhere near enough Its not a question of money Give me a minute here We have time to talk about this This is a world shaking event
Joe Biden,Number one no more subsidies for fossil fuel industry No more drilling on federal lands No more drilling including offshore No ability for the oil industry to continue to drill period ends number one Number two were in a situation as well where we cannot We are able to move rapidly to change the dynamic in terms of what we can do to set in motion The fact that he says climate change Paris Accord doesnt mean much We could get everything exactly right were  of the problem  of the problem is over there We need someone who can deal internationally We need someone who can bring the together again We need someone who can move in a direction that in fact if you violate the commitment you make you will pay an economic price for it Like whats happening in China there theyre exporting coal significant coal
Bernie Sanders,Okay Look obviously the Paris Accord is useful but it doesnt go anywhere If youre laughing Joe then youre missing the point
Bernie Sanders,This is an existential crisis
Bernie Sanders,You talk about Im talking about stopping fracking as soon as we possibly can Im talking about telling the fossil fuel industry that they are going to stop destroying this planet No ifs buts and maybes about it Im talking about speaking
Bernie Sanders,to China Well Im not sure your proposal does that Im talking about speaking to China to Russia to countries all over the world and in this moment making the point that instead of spending  trillion on weapons of destruction designed to kill each other maybe we should pool our resources and fight our common enemy which is climate change I know your heart is in the right place but this requires dramatic bold action Weve got to take on the fossil fuel industry Your plan does not do that
Joe Biden,My plan takes on the fossil fuel industry and it unites the world He just got finished saying whats he going to do Hes going to bring these countries together making it clear to them Im saying we bring them together make them live up to the commitments If they dont live up to the commitments they pay a financial price for it They pay an economic price for it Because we can do everything my state is three feet above sea level I dont need a lecture on whats going to happen about rising seas I know what happens I watched the whole Delmarva Peninsula just like it is in South Carolina and the rest Something I know a little bit about I wrote the first climate change bill that was in the Congress which PolitiFact said was a game changer Im the guy who came along and said with Dick Lugar that were going to trade well forgive your debt if you dont cut down your FARs Ive been way ahead of this curve This idea that all of a sudden Bernie found this out is amazing to me
Bernie Sanders,No Bernie didnt find it out Bernie is listening to the scientists and what Youre talking about making countries around the world fulfill their commitments Those commitments are not enough What this moment is about Joe is that the scientists are telling us they underestimated the severity of the crisis They were wrong The problem is more severe So all that Im saying right here is that we are fighting for the future of this planet for the wellbeing of our kids and future generations You cannot continue as I understand Joe believes to continue fracking correct me if Im wrong What we need to do right now is bringing the world together tell the fossil fuel industry that we are going to move aggressively to win solar sustainable energies
Joe Biden,No more no new fracking And by the way on the Recovery Act I was able to make sure we invested  billion in making sure we brought down the price of solar and wind that is lower than the price of coal Thats why not another new coal plant will be built I did that while you were watching number one Number two were in a situation where we in fact have the ability to lay down the tracks where no one can change the dynamic And thats why we should be talking about things like Ive been talking about for years high speed rail taking millions of automobiles off the road Making sure that we move in a direction where no more no more drilling on federal lands making sure that we invest in changing the entire fleet
Joe Biden,of the United States military to I know
Bernie Sanders,Because we have to invest in an unprecedented way in an unprecedented way You started off by saying that were talking about a   trillion investment That is a lot of money and Ive been criticized for that But I dont know what the alternative is if we are playing for the future of this planet So weve got to be dramatic and what being dramatic is massive investments in wind in solar and sustainable energies in general and research and development in making our buildings all over this country In my state of Vermont and around this country got a lot of old buildings We can put millions
Bernie Sanders,I have opposed or authoritarianism whether its in Cuba whether its in Saudi Arabia whether its in China or whether it is in Russia That is my life record I believe unlike the president of the United States in democracy not authoritarianism in Cuba or any place else
Bernie Sanders,What I believe right now in this world is that we are faced with a global crisis and a movement toward authoritarianism Thats what Putin in Russia is leading thats what MBS in Saudi Arabia is leading And as president of the United States unlike Donald Trump I will put the flag down and say that in this country and in this world we have got a move toward democracy and human rights That is my view and has always been my view
Bernie Sanders,Well I think you can make the same point about China China is undoubtedly an authoritarian society Okay But would anybody deny any economists deny that extreme poverty in China today is much less than what it was  or  years ago Thats a fact So I think we condemn authoritarianism whether its in China Russia Cuba any place else But to simply say that nothing ever done by any of those administrations had a positive impact on their people would I think be incorrect
Joe Biden,He was trying to change Cuban policies so the Cuban people would get out from under the thumb of the Castro and his brother That is to change the policy so that we can impact on Cubas policy by getting them opened up That was about but the praising of the Sandinistas the praising of Cuba the praising just now of China China is an authoritarian dictatorship Thats what it is We have to deal with them because theyre there
Joe Biden,But the idea that they in fact have increased the wealth of people in that country its been marginal that change thats taken place It is still they have a million Uyghurs a million Muslims in prison camps in the West You see whats happening in Hong Kong today And by the way the idea that he praised the Soviet Union when it was the Soviet Union about the things that they had done well they are an awful dictatorship killing millions and millions of people
Joe Biden,And in addition to that we have a circumstance where after the election was all over and we knew what was done by the Russians now and interfering with our elections this man voted against sanctioning Russia for interference in our elections
Bernie Sanders,Well what you dont get in This is exactly what the problem with politics is about All right Question Did China make progress in ending extreme poverty over the last  years Thats a no
Joe Biden,Thats like saying Jack the ripper
Bernie Sanders,You see Joe this is the problem
Bernie Sanders,This is the problem We cant talk  I know theres a political line I understand Chinas terrible awful nothing ever good inaudible  but the fact of the matter is China of course is an authoritarian state Its what I just said
Bernie Sanders,Thats what I just said five minutes ago And by the way the question that was asked quoted Barack Obama president Obama was more generous in his praise of what Cuba did in healthcare and education than I was I was talking about a program  years ago in the first year of the Castro revolution
Bernie Sanders,So the bottom line is that I think its a little bit absurd if were going to look at the world the way it is Of course we are opposed to authoritarian And by the way before it was considered good policy good idea I was condemning the dictatorship in Saudi Arabia when a lot of other people in Washington
Bernie Sanders,I was condemning the dictatorship in the UAE you were not
Joe Biden,Look the idea of occasionally saying something nice about a country is one thing The idea of praising a country that is violating human rights around the world is in fact makes our allies wonder whats going on What do you think the South Koreans think when he praises China like that What do you think the Australians believe in the shadow of China What do you think is happening in Indonesia in the shadow of China What do you think is happening in terms of Japan in the shadow of China Words matter These are flat out dictators period and they should be called for it Straight up We may have to work out
Joe Biden,For example I was able to help negotiate a new start agreement with Russia not because I like Putin the guy is a thug
Joe Biden,I learned I cant take the word of a president when in fact they assured me that they would not use force Remember the context the context was the United Nations Security Council was going to vote to insist that we allow inspectors into determine whether or not they were in fact producing nuclear weapons or weapons of mass destruction They were not
Joe Biden,And whats the first thing that happened when we got elected The president Obama turned to me and said get those troops out of the hours responsible for getting  combat troops out of Iraq I admitted  years ago was in spect  to have trusted him and Im prepared to compare my foreign policy credentials up against my friend here on any day of the week and every day of the week
Bernie Sanders,Okay lets start off with the war in Iraq Joe I was there too I was in the house I understood  and by the way lets be clear about what that vote was and you were there at the signing ceremony with Bush Everybody in the world knew that when you voted for that resolution you were giving Bush the authority to go to war and everybody knew thats exactly what he and Cheney wanted to do
Bernie Sanders,Most people who followed that issue closely understood that the Bush administration was lying through its teeth with regard to Saddam having weapons of mass destruction I understood that I was on the floor of the house time and time again But the issue is not just the war in Iraq That was a long time ago The issue is the trade agreement What is it so easy for me to lead the effort against disastrous trade agreements
Bernie Sanders,The issue was the bankruptcy bill that you supported The issue was the Hyde amendment The issue is the defense of marriage Act The issue is whether or not in difficult times and God knows these are difficult times Were going to have the courage to take on powerful special interest and do whats right for the working families of this country
Joe Biden,Why did you vote not to sanction the Russians
Bernie Sanders,You know why Because I had every  you keep talking about Iran that was tied to Iran Russia was in Iran I think John Kerry indicated his support for what I did That was undermining the Iranian agreement Thats why
Bernie Sanders,Thats why and thats the only reason why I have condemned Russia time and time again
Joe Biden,The fact is that the idea that I in fact supported the things that you suggested is not accurate Look Im the guy that helped put together the Iran deal and got the inspectors in there My chief of staff was the guy my foreign policy guy doing that negotiation I was the guy that helped put together a nation organization to take on the ISIS in Iraq and in Syria Ive dealt with these folks I know them and I know what theyre like and I know who the good guys are and who the bad guys are
Joe Biden,The fact is this Bernies notion about how he embraces folks like the Sandinistas and Cuba and the former Soviet Union and talks about the good things they did in China is absolutely contrary to every message we want to send the rest of the world
Bernie Sanders,I have led the effort against all forms of authoritarianism including Americas socalled allies in the UAE and in Saudi Arabia And in fact as you may know worked with conservative Republicans to utilize for the very first time the War Powers Act to get the United States out of the horrific war in Yemen led by Saudi Arabia Thats what I did So my view is that in a world moving toward authoritarianism the United States has got to be the leader where people all over the world look to us for guidance
Joe Biden,Well look my message has resonated across the board Every single state weve been in theres been a significant turnout In Virginia turnout was up  they voted for me He didnt bring them out I brought them out And number two look whats happened in Mississippi Look whats happened in North Carolina look whats happened in Washington state Look whats happening across the board Why is it that Im winning all those places Whats the reason Whats the reason The reason is because they know I am a Democrat with a capital D who in fact believes that our base is the base of the Democratic party which are hardworking men and women who are in fact are high school educated African Americans and minorities including Hispanics but all minorities Suburban women people who in fact have a sense of our place in the world Thats why I am winning not just winning but overwhelmingly winning not even close in these places And
Bernie Sanders,Here is what I believe is happening and this is an important point and why I decided to run for president I think its imperative that we defeat Trump I think our campaign of a biracial bigenerational multigenerational grassroots movement is the way to do it Now we have won some states Joe has won more States than I have but heres what we are winning We are winning the ideological struggle Even in States like Mississippi where Joe won a major victory It turns out that a pretty good majority of the folks there believe in Medicare for  and thats true in almost every state in this country
Bernie Sanders,And the other issue that we dont talk enough about is we are winning the generational struggle Depending on the state were winning people  years of age or younger big time people  years of age and younger I frankly have my doubts
Bernie Sanders,Look if I lose this thing Joe wins Joe I will be there for you But I have my doubts about how you win a general election against Trump will be a very very tough opponent unless you have energy excitement the largest voter turnout in history And to do that you are going to have to bring young people who are not great voters They dont vote in the kinds of numbers they should into the political process Youre going to have to bring Latinos who are great people have the agenda that we need but also dont vote in the numbers that we need I have my doubts that vice president Bidens campaign can generate that energy and excitement and that voter turnout
Joe Biden,I will do that And by the way just get this straight The energy and excitement is taking place so far has been for me  turnout increased in Virginia I can go down the list theyre coming out for me and I didnt even have the money to compete with this man in those States I virtually had no money The press kept saying Biden has no money and they were right by net no money And the idea why are they doing that The reason theyre doing that is because they understand I know what has to happen that I know what needs to be done
Joe Biden,And by the way the idea that everybody supports Medicare for all he has still hadnt indicated how much its going to cost people Hes yet to know exactly whats going to  So heres my point People dont know the detail at all and the fact is I am winning
Joe Biden,overwhelmingly among democratic constituencies across the board
Bernie Sanders,Well our hearts go out to everyone We need to move aggressively to make sure that every person in this country who has the virus who thinks they have the virus understands they get all the healthcare that they need because they are Americans that we move aggressively to make sure that the test kits are out there that the ventilators are out there that the ICU units are out there that the medical personnel are out there
Bernie Sanders,But Jake if I might also say that in this moment of economic uncertainty in addition to the coronavirus it is time to ask how we get to where we are not only our lack of preparation for the virus but how we end up with an economy with so many about people are hurting at a time of massive income and wealth inequality It is time to ask the question of where the power is in America Who owns the media Who owns the economy Who owns the legislative process Why do we give tax breaks to billionaires and not raise the minimum wage
Bernie Sanders,Why do we pump up the oil industry while a half a million people are homeless in America This is the time to move aggressively dealing with the coronavirus crisis to deal with the economic fallout but its also a time to rethink America and create a country where we care about each other rather than a nation of greed and corruption which is what is taking place among the corporate elite
Joe Biden,Number one as I said at the outset I just cant imagine what people are going through right now who have lost someone already I cant imagine what people are going through when they have a mom Like for example a good friend of ours is sitting outside the window of a nursing home where her mom is because she cant go in trying to do sign language to her mom and through the window to be able to talk to her I guess I can imagine the fear and concern people have Number one one of the things that I think we have to understand is that this is an all hands on deck This is as someone said maybe it was you Jake at the outset this is bigger than any individual This is bigger than yourself This is about America This is about the world This is about how we bring people together and make the kind of sacrifices we need to make to get this done and so first and foremost where we have to do is start to listen to the science again
Joe Biden,As I said what we did we met and that what Id be doing today Id be sitting down in the situation room literally every day like we did at the outset of other crises we had when we were in the White House and pulling together the best people and not just the United States the world and say What is it What are the prescriptive moves we have to take now to lessen this virus to beat it to go to the point where we can save more lives get more people tested get more people to kind of care they need
Joe Biden,And then what do we do beyond that to make sure that the economic impact on them is in fact rendered harmless That we in fact make sure every paycheck is met every paycheck thats out there that the people are going to miss that we keep people in their homes they dont miss their mortgage payments they dont miss their rent payments making sure that theyre going to be able to take care of education and by the way the education systems are closing down right now and so theres so many things we have to do
Joe Biden,In addition to that we have to do is we have to have the best science in the world and telling us what can stay open and what need be closed Like I said earlier the idea that we are closing schools which I understand but not being able to provide lunches for people who in fact need the school lunch program to get by The idea that we would close any place that I can understand the decision made to close places where a hundred or  people or more gather but how do you keep open the drug store to make sure you can get your prescription How do you deal with the things that necessarily have to be kept going and whats the way to do that There should be a national standard for that It should be coming out of the situation room right now
Joe Biden,And by the way the single most significant thing we can do should deal with the larger problem down the road of income inequality is get rid of Donald Trump Donald Trump Hes exacerbated every single one of these problems both the immediate urgent need and how were going to hold people harmless for the damage done as a consequence of this virus Its important we do both
