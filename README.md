# Machine-Learning-for-Security-Operations

- The NLTK Speech Tagging folder contains a python file that reads a presidential debate text file and creates a pandas dataframe with the president and the statement they made during a debate. The script also preprocesses the text by removing special characters and stop words and creates a predictive/supervised learning machine learning model using KNN in Scikit learn module to predict which presidential candidate made the statement.
