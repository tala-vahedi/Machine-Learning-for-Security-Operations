- The NLTK Speech Tagging folder contains a python file that reads a presidential debate text file and creates a pandas dataframe with the president and the statement they made during a debate. The script also preprocesses the text by removing special characters and stop words and creates a predictive/supervised learning machine learning model using KNN in Scikit learn module to predict which presidential candidate made the statement.

- The NBclassifier.py script leverages the pre-labeled male and female name files from the NLTK library to create a supervised/predictive machine learning algorithm to predict whether a name belongs to a male or female. The script performs several feature engineering and feature extraction tasks to extract more information from each name in order to train and test the models accuracy in correctly predicting names.

- The sentimentAnalysis folder contains a jupyter notebook py script that reads a csv file with nuclear powerplant data regarding global warming. The script first preprocesses the data by removing special characters and stop words, drops unneccesary columns, and performs sentiment analysing using the K-Nearest Neighbor classification model from Scikit learn module in python 3.8.
